# The parable of Ox

Author starts with an interesting parable not just about financial market, but actually related to many aspects of economics. This parable is worth remembering for every economist and business man.

> In 1906, Francis Galton observed a weight guessing competition at a country fair. 800 people guessed the weight of an ox. He discovered that average guess was very closed to the true weight of the ox. (***LLN***)

What follows is cleverly made by the author.
- The organizer started to use the average weight as the true weight.
- Some guesser tried to cheat based on the privileged information from the farmer who raised the ox. Others would be reluctant to participate in the competition since some insiders had an edge. With few participants, the **_LLN_** fails. (**Lemon Market - Asymmetric Information Problem**)
- Regulation was introduced to save the weight discovery mechansim. The farmer was asked to reveal all the relevant information to the public, and was forbidden to provide insider information to anyone, or else he would be expelled from the market.
- Some smarter guy started to realized that since the award was not based on the true weight of the ox, but the average of the guessing weights. What mattered were the guesses of the other participants.
  - The key lay not in correctly assessing the weight of the ox, but in correctly assessing what others would guess.
  - When more and more people started to think that way. A rational partipants would start to guess what other people would guess others would guess, and so on.
- The whole weight guessing competition became the "guess" guessing competition. In order to have a valid guess (**_LLN_** needs to work), a large number of guesses were required. That comes the financial economist and econometricians who developed models to estimate what, if there had actually been many guesses, the average of the guesses would have been.
- No one cared about the true weight of the ox. One one cared whether the ox was alive or dead.
